/**
 * EASY


 Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your
 possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the
 minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins can have
 any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have
 multiple coins of the same value).

 For example, if you're given coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum
 amount of change that you can't create is 4. If you're given no
 coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 1.

 Sample Input
 coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]

 Sample Output<
 20
